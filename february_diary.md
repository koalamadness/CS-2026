Una view es una tabla virtual basada en una consulta SELECT. No almacena datos físicamente, sino que ejecuta la consulta cada vez que se accede a ella. Se usa para seguridad, simplificación de consultas y abstracción de la base de datos.

📌 1. Segunda persona con mayor salario
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);


O usando LIMIT:

SELECT salary 
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

📌 2. Encontrar empleados con salario mayor al promedio
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

📌 3. Encontrar duplicados en una tabla
SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

📌 4. Diferencia entre INNER JOIN y LEFT JOIN

Pregunta típica teórica + práctica:

SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.id;

As the opposite, unchecked exceptions aren’t checked at the compile time. 

The most common unchecked exceptions are: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, IllegalArgumentException, NullPointerException. 

Unchecked exceptions are thrown during runtime. The following code will throw a NullPointerException. Probably it’s one of the most common exceptions in Java.


**Collections Primitive**

4.1. Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
A checked exception means that it’s checked at the compile time. Note, that we must handle this exception. Otherwise, a method must specify an exception by using throws keyword.

The most common checked exceptions are IOException, FileNotFoundException, ParseException. FileNotFoundException may be thrown when we create FileInputStream from File.
